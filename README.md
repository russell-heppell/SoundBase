go to your SoundBase, go to your Wishlist, or do a search on Discogs. When going to do
a search on discogs, you are brought to the search page.

Search page

The search page has 3 text fields, for Artist, Album, and format type. when doing a
search, you must provide at least one of these fields in order to do a search. Once you
click 'Search Discogs', you are brought to the results page.

Search Results Page

The search results page is in a table view, showing the album image, artist and album
name, year, and format in a single cell. If you click on a result, you are brought to
another view with the details and the options to either add the music item to your
SoundBase or add it to your wishList. When either are clicked, an alert pops up when the
add is successful. when added to your SoundBase, you are reminded to give the item a
rating as well.

table form as well, with the same layout as the search results page. when you click in a
cell, a details page pops up with the same layout, with the ability to add/edit your user
rating for the music item. When clicked, a prompt for you to enter the new rating will
appear, and the changes will be applied. you can also delete items from the soundBase by
simply swiping to the left on an item from the table view.

Wishlist Page

When navigated to your Wishlist from the home page, you will view the wishlist in a
table form as well, with the same layout as the search results page. when you click in a
cell, a details page pops up with the same layout, with the ability to move the item to
your SoundBase when its purchased. when tapped, an alert pops up saying the item has been
moved once successful, and a reminder to give a rating also appears. Deleting items from
